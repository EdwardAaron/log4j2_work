Filters用于过滤日志事件

Filters may be configured in one of four locations:
    1. Context-wide Filters are configured directly in the configuration. Events that are rejected by
    these filters will not be passed to loggers for further processing. Once an event has been accepted
    by a Context-wide filter it will not be evaluated by any other Context-wide Filters nor will the
    Logger's Level be used to filter the event. The event will be evaluated by Logger and Appender
    Filters however.
    2. Logger Filters are configured on a specified Logger. These are evaluated after the Contextwide Filters and the Log Level for the Logger. Events that are rejected by these filters will be
    discarded and the event will not be passed to a parent Logger regardless of the additivity setting.
    3. Appender Filters are used to determine if a specific Appender should handle the formatting and
    publication of the event.
    4. Appender Reference Filters are used to determine if a Logger should route the event to an
    appender.
